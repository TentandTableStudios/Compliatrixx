What is Compliatrixx?
Compliatrixx is a tool for Windows that checks if your computer meets common security and IT compliance rules. It runs a bunch of tests—like checking if your firewall is on, if your disk is encrypted, if you have antivirus, and if passwords are strong and shows you what passes or fails in a simple list.

You don’t have to be an expert: just run the app and press “Start Deep Compliance Scan.” Results are color-coded and easy to understand.

Custom Policy Editor
You can use the Policy Settings panel (click the ⚙️ button) to choose which security rules you care about.
Turn individual checks on or off, or set things like minimum password length and how much free disk space is required.
Compliatrixx will use your settings as the standard for a passing scan.

IMPORTANT: Run as Administrator
Compliatrixx works best when you run it as an Administrator.
Some system checks (like disk encryption, firewall, or antivirus status) may not be accurate or available unless you launch the app with admin rights.
If you don’t, you’ll still see results for basic checks but for the full picture, always run as admin.

That’s it—fast, simple, and useful.
No registry hacking or scripting required.
No data leaves your PC.
